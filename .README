Vend-O-Matic

Gameplan:
✔ 1. Start with initiating all the necessary files first. Use minimal dependencies (though I'll use tailwind). Can start skeleton, but don't go beyond that yet.
✔ 2. Define data model. Drinks will have name, price, and initialStock.
    - Do we need to separate out the data model? It's just one model used for one service. Let's just keep it simple.
✔ 3. Define the core business. drink inventory, coins.
⏱︎ 4. Logic to make vending machine work (I forgot to make service file in Step 1)
    - get inventory
    - get item
    - insert coin ($0.25 each)
    - return coin (any invalid coins)
    - buy drink - check if valid drink; if valid, check if enough inventory; then check input coins vs cost; 
        - successfully buying the drink: remove from inventory, determine change (coins - price), reset coins
✔ 5. Setup express server and middleware.
⏱︎ 6. Write the API routes.
7. Frontend: define state management. 
    - coins
    - drinks
    - message
8. Use API Calls to make the actions.
9. Frontend: Build out the UI.
10. Frontend: Tailwind it out to make it pretty.
