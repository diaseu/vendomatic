Vend-O-Matic

Gameplan:
✔ 1. Start with initiating all the necessary files first. Use minimal dependencies (though I'll use tailwind). Can start skeleton, but don't go beyond that yet.
✔ 2. Define data model. Drinks will have name, price, and initialStock.
3. Define the core business as application state. inventory, coins.
4. Logic to make vending machine work:
    - insert coin ($0.25 each)
    - buy drink [ this needs more logic but come back to this ] - success: right number of coins (no change), too many coins (yes change). fail: not enough coins (yes change), not enough inventory. 
    - return coin (any leftover coins)
5. Setup express server and middleware.
6. Write the API routes.
7. Frontend: define state management. 
    - coins
    - drinks
    - message
8. Use API Calls to make the actions.
9. Frontend: Build out the UI.
10. Frontend: Tailwind it out to make it pretty.
